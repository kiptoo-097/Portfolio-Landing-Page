            I decided to do Programming since With more than 4 billion users on the internet, the application of
            computer coding is more important than ever. And, the
            computer science field attracts some of the most talented minds around the world. Graduates from programming
            or computer
            science courses secure rewarding and unique career opportunities in various fields, like environment,
            medicine, gaming,
            business operations and finance.
